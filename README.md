This is a SKSE plugin that wraps CommonLibSSE and presents it to Python. 
The idea is to leverage the Python VM to the maximum capacity to enable average
people, to write python scripts that interface with Skyrim.

Note: this was originally forked from : https://github.com/Ryan-rsm-McKenzie so thank you to Ryan for the setup of all the CMake files and the like


## Requirements
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
	* Add this to your `PATH`
* [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830)
	* Add the environment variable `Skyrim64Path` to point to the root installation of your game directory (the one containing `SkyrimSE.exe`).
* [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
	* Add the environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` with the value as the path to the folder containing vcpkg
* [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
	* Desktop development with C++

## Building
```
git clone https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/SkyrimPy
cd ExamplePlugin-CommonLibSSE
git submodule init
git submodule update
cmake --preset vs2022-windows
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## Tips
* Set `COPY_OUTPUT` to `ON` to automatically copy the built dll to the game directory, i.e. `cmake --preset vs2022-windows -DCOPY_OUTPUT=ON`
* Build the `package` target to automatically build and zip up your dll in a ready-to-distribute format.
